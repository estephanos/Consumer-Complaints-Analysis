## Cleaning the Data

After looking at the data we noticed that it was pretty clean. We only changed the blank cells to reflect "N/A" and changed the Zip Code column to be numeric. 

`complaints$ZIP.code <- as.numeric(complaints$ZIP.code)`

`complaints$Consumer.consent.provided. <- ifelse(complaints$Consumer.consent.provided. == "", "N/A",complaints$Consumer.consent.provided.)`

`complaints$Sub.product <- ifelse(complaints$Sub.product == "", "N/A",complaints$Sub.product)`

`complaints$Sub.issue<- ifelse(complaints$Sub.issue == "", "N/A",complaints$Sub.issue)`

`complaints$Consumer.complaint.narrative <- ifelse(complaints$Consumer.complaint.narrative == "", "N/A",complaints$Consumer.complaint.narrative)`

`complaints$Company.public.response <- ifelse(complaints$Company.public.response == "", "N/A",complaints$Company.public.response)`

`complaints$Tags<- ifelse(complaints$Tags == "", "N/A",complaints$Tags)`

`complaints$Consumer.disputed.<- ifelse(complaints$Consumer.disputed. == "", "N/A",complaints$Consumer.disputed.)`

## Sentiment Analysis

![Bing Sentiment](/Images/BingPlot.png)

Bing within R only categorizes by positive or negative words. The graph above shows that that are more negative words than positive words within the consumer complaint narrative. 
We assumed since the dataset was about complaints that there would more negative words used when consumers talked to the companies about issues they were having.
